<Description>
  A class for deploying an arbitrary repy program on a number of vessels.
  Built on top of the Experiment Library, Overlord persistently manages a
  user-defined number of vessels, ensuring that the specified service is up
  and running.

  The behavior of an Overlord object can be customized to fit the
  user's needs. They can be overriden with the user's own functions, although
  certain restrictions on behavior and argument passing still apply.
  Details, along with the default function's coding, are listed near the end.

<Requirements>
  An instance of the Experiment Library must exist in a subdirectory named
  'experimentlibrary'. This directory can be setup by following the
  instructions on the Seattle wiki:
  https://seattle.cs.washington.edu/wiki/ExperimentLibrary

  Also note that Overlord requires a secure connection to SeattleGENI.
  To perform secure SSL communication with SeattleGENI, you must:
    * Have M2Crypto installed (http://chandlerproject.org/Projects/MeTooCrypto)
    * Have a PEM file, cacert.pem, containing CA certificates in the
      experimentlibrary directory. One such file can be found at
      http://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert.pem

  For more inforation on SSL communication with SeattleGENI, see
  https://seattle.cs.washington.edu/wiki/SeattleGeniClientLib
  
<Usage>
  To create an Overlord client, simply import it:

    import overlord

  and then initiate an Overlord object with your desired parameters and execute
  its 'run()' function.
  For example, to deploy time servers on 10 wan vessels:

    import overlord
    time_server = overlord.Overlord(GENI_USERNAME, 10, 'wan', 'time_server.repy')
    time_server.run(time_server.config['geni_port'])

  Note that time_server.repy requires a port number as an argument, so the user's
  GENI port is passed to the run() function.
    
  For more examples of using this experimentlib, see the examples/ directory.

  Please also see the following wiki page for usage information and how to
  obtain the latest version of this library:
  https://seattle.cs.washington.edu/wiki/Overlord


  AL: CUSTOMIZING OVERLORD'S LOGGING BEHAVIOR

  By default, Overlord will log directly to console screen without saving a log
  file if no filename was passed for the argument 'log_filename' during
  initialization. In order to log to both a file and to console screen, in 
  addition to passing the filename of the log file during initialization, a
  console logger needs to be added to the Overlord instances logger like so:

    import logging
    import overlord
    # Initialization of Overlord instance that logs to test_log.log
    overl_instance = overlord.Overlord(GENI_USERNAME, 10, "wan", "test.repy", "test_log.log")
    # Initialization of a log stream to console
    consoleLog = logging.StreamHandler()
    consoleLog.setFormatter(logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s %(levelname)-8s %(message)s', '%H:%M:%S'))
    # Adding the console logger to Overlord's logging behavior,
    # thus allowing it to log both to file and to console
    overl_instance.logger.addHandler(consoleLog)



  AL: CUSTOMIZING OVERLORD'S RUN OPERATIONS

  After initialization of the overlord's instance as an object, the default
  functions can be overriden by simply setting the respective variables listed
  below with the name of the user's own functions.

  For example, to have Overlord just print 'foo' instead of performing its default
  start-up procedure, after initiating an instance of overlord but before running it:
  
    # Overriding run()'s start-up operations to just print "foo"
    time_server.init_overlord_func = print_foo
    ...
    # The coding for the method, taking the required overlord instance argument
    def print_foo(overlord):
      print "foo"
    ...

  Further details on the functions that make up run(), a brief description of
  their purpose, and requirements and restrictions are user's override methods
  are listed as follows:

  Note: In addition to taking in arguments specified in the notes that follows,
  each function is expected to take in an Overlord object for access to
  the particular instance's variables.

  init_overlord_func : How you want overlord's run() operations to start-up.
                       By default, it will automatically release any vessels
                       currently owned by the SeattleGENI identity.
                       Should not return anything at the end of its function.

  acquire_vessels_func : How you want overlord to acquire vessels.
                         By default, acquires up to the amount specified in 
                         config['vessel_count'] of the type specified in 
                         config['vessel_type'], but no more than what the 
                         user's vessel credit allows them to have.
                         Should take in a list of vesselhandles to keep track of
                         any changes in the list of vessels owned, and return
                         a list of newly acquired vesselhandles, if any.

  init_vessels_func : How you want overlord to set-up the vessels upon acquisition.
                      By default, uploads and runs the program specified in
                      config['program_filename'], and releases any vessels that 
                      failed during the process
                      Should take in a list of newly acquired vesselhandles and
                      a list of currently owned vesselhandles. Should return a
                      newly updated list of vesselhandles that includes ones
                      currently owned and new vessels that were successfully
                      initialized
 
  remove_vessels_func : How you want overlord to deal with vessels of
                        certain status.
                        By default, releases any vessels that have any status
                        other than 'Started'
                        Should take in and return a list of vessels that the
                        SeattleGENI identity currently owns.

  maintenance_func : How you want overlord to maintain the vessels
                     By default, renews the vessels automatically every 2 days at
                     minimum, and does a polling loop every 15 minutes.
                     Should take in a timedelta object to keep track of renewal
                     delay and the time of last renewal, and return the updated
                     time of renewal

  UNMODIFABLE BEHAVIOR 
  There are some behavior in the overlord's run function that cannot be modified,
  and they are listed in the following:
  - Retrieval of identity's current list of vessels, regardless
      of start-up function
  - Setting the time of last renewal to be the current time of
      its execution
  - The creation of a timedelta object from VESSEL_RENEWAL_PERIOD
  - 'Sleeping' Overlord's process at the end of each loop for the amount of time
      specified in VESSEL_RENEWAL_PERIOD
